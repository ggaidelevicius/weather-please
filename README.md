Weather Please is a new tab replacement extension that is suitable for any browser that supports extensions (such as chromium).

It displays maximum and minimum temperatures, a general prognosis, maximum UV index, maximum wind speed, and chance of precipitation for the current day, as well as up to 8 days into the future.

It also displays weather alerts in the case of extreme UV, high precipitation, strong wind, and low visibility. All alerts are fully toggleable on a per alert-type basis.

Both metric and imperial number formats are supported.

Weather Please uses [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) as the source for all weather data.
