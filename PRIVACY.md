# Privacy Policy for the "Weather Please" Browser Extension

_Last updated: March 02, 2025_

Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines what data the "Weather
Please" browser extension may collect and how it is used.

## 1. Information We Don't Collect

"Weather Please" does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data
related to your browsing activity. We do not access, retain, or share data such
as IP addresses, browsing history, or any personally identifiable information.

## 2. Geolocation Data and Third-Party Services

To retrieve local weather information, "Weather Please" requires access to your
device's geolocation (latitude and longitude). Upon installation, you will be
prompted to allow location access. If you decline, the extension will not
function.

Location data is sent directly to third-party weather services to fetch weather
updates. These services operate under their own privacy policies, which you can
review here:

"Weather Please" does not store or transmit your location data beyond the
request to these services.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. Your geolocation is used
**only** to retrieve weather data from third-party services.

## 4. Your Choices

You may choose whether to grant location access when prompted. If you do not
allow it, the extension will not function. By using "Weather Please," you
acknowledge and accept this requirement.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on
this page and take effect immediately upon posting.
